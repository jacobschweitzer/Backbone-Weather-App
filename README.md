Backbone.js Weather

An Backbone.js app that grabs live weather data.

This is an example of what I can make using Backbone.js and was created to get some more experience integrating it with a live API.

It uses the Backbone.js, Underscore.js, Open Weather Maps API, the Google Static Maps API,  and Backbone.localStorage (https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage).

This app will store the cities you've added in Local Storage in your browser, so the next time you visit the page the same cities will load again with fresh weather data.
